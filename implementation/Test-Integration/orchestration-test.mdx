title: Workflow Tests
description: In this, we learn about Workflow Testing which evaluates the end-to-end behavior and performance of the entire workflow in various scenarios.
---
After completing node-level testing, workflow tests allows users to assess the seamless execution of interconnected nodes, data flow, and overall workflow behavior. By simulating real-world scenarios and diverse payloads, users can ensure the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of their integrations.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. End-to-End Workflow Testing

Validate the entire workflow from start to finish to ensure all nodes function correctly in sequence. Try executing the Workflow through the [Try API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/ship/tryapi) section. Test scenarios include:

- Triggering the workflow with different input data or payload.

- Verifying the expected output at the end of the workflow.
For eg: If the Workflow is supposed to create a New Contact on a successful execution, then check whether the Contact was created or not in the account.

### 2. Error Handling Testing 

Evaluate the system's response to errors and exceptions within the workflow. Test scenarios include:

- Introducing errors at different nodes to test error recovery mechanisms.
- Verifying error notifications and logging.

### 3. Performance Testing 

Assess the performance and scalability of the workflow under varying load conditions. Test scenarios include:

- Simulating high-volume data processing.
- Monitoring response times and resource utilization.

### 4. Integration Point Validation 

Verify the integration points with external systems and services for data exchange. Test scenarios include:
- Testing API integrations with different payloads.
- Validating data consistency across integrated systems.

## Execution and Verification Process
Follow the steps mentioned below to perform Orchestration testing in Cobalt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Test Data">
    Define test data and payloads in [Events](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/basics/events) to simulate different scenarios.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Workflow Tests">
    Trigger the workflow with predefined test data through the Try API section to observe the behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and Analyze">
    Monitor the workflow execution, data flow, and system responses for anomalies.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Results">
    Compare the actual response with expected results to ensure the workflow functions as intended. To check the status of Workflow, navigate to `Logs` > `Executions` in Cobalt and check the workflow status.
    <Tip>
    Learn more about Workflow logs [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/maintain/logs).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
    <Step title="Iterate and Optimize">
    Identify areas for improvement, optimize performance, and refine the workflow based on Logs obtained.
  </Step>
