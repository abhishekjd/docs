description: Create a sample workflow to create new data in Salesforce using Events
---

Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to Salesforce.

This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added.

In the Salesforce integration, go to `Workflows` and create a new workflow by clicking on `+Add Workflow` button and name it as `Create New Contact`.


Follow the steps given to build the workflow:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Trigger in Start Node">

    All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow.
   For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger.
  <Tip>
  Learn more about the triggers and its types [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/triggering_workflow).
  </Tip>
    Click on the `Start Node`, select your native app option and click on `+ Create New Event`.

Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Salesforce Node">
  Now to create a new contact in Salesforce, we need to call Salesforce API.

  Click on `Nodes` option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from **Native Apps** section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Action in node">
    Click on Salesforce Node and add the `Create Contact` action.
    To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the **Event** tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload.

<Warning>
Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Salesforce API will give error.
</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

And done, you can now successfully create a contact in Salesforce whenever the event is triggered. 
<Tip>
Refer to the Trigger Event API [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/event/trigger-event) to fire the event and workflow.
