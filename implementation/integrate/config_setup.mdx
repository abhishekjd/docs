These customizations can then be used in the workflows for various use-cases.

Consider an example where you want to sync all the contacts from Salesforce and your users provide you the mapping for the contact fields. Provided below is an example of how a mapping config dataslot appears to users.

Your users can perform the mapping of the fields which you can use in the workflow while syncing contacts.

Let's add a Static Mapping of contact fields in Salesforce.

    Click on `Edit` for the dataslot >  In the **Source** provide a name and add all the fields as Options that you want the user to map.

  </Step>
<Step title="Map Salesforce fields in Destination">
    Provide a name for `Destination` and choose type as `Contact Fields`. This will load all the fields from the Salesforce contact object.
</Step>
<Step title="Save">
    Click on `Save Field` and the dataslot is now added for your users to map in config.
