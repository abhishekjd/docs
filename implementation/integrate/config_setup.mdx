title: Build End-User Config
---
Config is a customization that you store for each integration of all your end-customers.

These customizations can then be used in the workflows for various use-cases. 
<Tip>
Learn more about Config and its types [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/connectors/config/config).
</Tip>

Consider an example where you want to sync all the contacts of a particular list from Salesforce and your users provide you the list from which the contacts should be synced. Provided below is an example of how a select config dataslot appears to users.

Let's add a dataslot of Contact Lists in Salesforce.
<Tip>
Learn more about Select Field Type [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/connectors/config/field_type_intro#select-field-types).
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Dataslot in Config Portal">
    Click on the `Config Portal` in Salesforce and click on `Add Field` button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide details">
    Provide a name to the dataslot and select `Type` as **List Contact List Values**. Click on `Add Field`.
    <Tip>
    Click on `Edit` for the dataslot and mark it as `Required` so that the workflow will not execute if this is not selected by the users.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
<Step title="Save">
    Click on `Save Field` and the dataslot is now added for your users to select a list in config.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
To use this dataslot in the [Sync workflow](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/workflow/sync_using_proxy), you would need to change the action in Node 2 to `Get Contacts Of A particular List` and provide this dataslot in **Enter List ID** field.
</Note>

You can get this Config of your users after they perform selection by using the Config API or SDK Method.
