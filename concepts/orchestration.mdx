Cobalt lets you orchestrate the way you want to handle your use-cases by letting you create and customize workflows, define the prerequisite data that you 
wish to access from the customer for those workflows, set visibility and accesibility and a lot more. 

### Workflow
Workflows in Cobalt are robust, and retry-enabled tasks, capable of initiation either by an application event or a user defined event. 
These workflows serve as a powerful tool for constructing the logic underpinning your integration usecases within Cobalt. With Workflows, developers can easily
implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users' apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling 
non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding.

Once you have created  [auth flow](/concepts/auth-flows) for your customer and have access to their data, you can setup a workflow using Cobalt's [workflow builder](/guides/workflow).

#### Workflow Builder
Cobalt's workflow builder provides a visual representation of your orchestration. The building blocks of a workflow are called `nodes`. Every workflow starts
with a `start node` which takes in atleast one `trigger` which defines the initiation of the worflow. A Workflow execution starts with the start node and is 
followed by `action nodes` which are the visual representation of the logic being implented under the hood. The actions can be connected to the trigger or other 
actions depending upon the choice/sequence of execution. The workflow builder provides various tools and simplified application api methods for creating robust orchestrations
without requiring in-depth knowledge of each API provider.

#### Triggers
Triggers are the starting point of any workflow. A trigger defines when a worflow is executed. Cobalt supports application events and user defined events both 
for triggering a workflow. A user can created a [custom event]() or select from the list of application events as trigger(s) in the start node. User defined events need
to be fired by the user as and when required to trigger the worflow, whereas, application events are fired by the respective applications when an event occurs.

#### Actions
Apart from the third-paty application api actions, Cobalt provides tools such as `Custom code`, `Rule`, `Delay` and more to complement the use-case a user wants to achieve.
A workflow has atlease one action to be functional. These actions are connected with the start node or with each other depending upon how one wants them to be executed.
Cobalt supports sequential as well as parallel executions of actions.

#### Configurations
Cobalt lets users to configure the data accesibility in a worflow and the workflow itself as per their requirement. The user can set visibility of worflows for their customer.
Since Cobalt also grants the end customers to view and enable/disable a workflow in the auth-flow portal, this feature comes in handy if the user do not wish to show
these workflows. For more configuration details check out this [guide](/guides/workflow).

#### Logs
Cobalt provides detailed insights of any orchestration through event, workflow and webhook [logs](/concepts/logs) so that user has a better understanding od what happens under the hood.
Cobalt also provides a `retry` option to users incase of an error, so that user can fix the issue and re re-run the execution there itself and avoid missing on an important data.
