title: Event Model
description: "Common model for custom user defined events"
---

Cobalt supports User defined custom events to trigger a workflow. While creating such an event user needs to create a model as well. This model defines what
the event expects to be sent as a payload while being fired by the user. The properties of this model can be used as trigger variables in the workflow and can be
accessed by using a `$`, helping the user to pass any linked account specific dynamic value in a worflow instead to hardcoding a static value.

A single user defined event model can be used to trigger multiple worflows across multiple applications and its properties accessed similarly everywhere, irrespective
of any application.

### Steps to create an event
A user can create an event through the platform or an api as per their requirement. To create an event using an api please visit this [documentation](/api-reference/event).
Creating an event requires three very easy steps:
1. Visit [default app](https://app.gocobalt.io/your-app) > `Events`
2. Enter the name of the event that you want to create. For example, "Create a customer"
3. Create a json model of properties inside `Response`, that you wish to send to cobalt while firing this event with sample values. For example,
```json Sample event model
{
  "customer_name": "Mark Wood",
  "age": 30,
  "associated_emails": ["mark@example.com", "wood.mark@sampleemail.com"],
  "is_new": true,
  "address": {
    "house_number": 24,
    "apartment": "Greenville Apartments",
    "street": "Swan lake st.",
    "city": "Bengaluru"
  }
}
```
And done!. The event is ready to be fired, and the model properties to be accessed in the workflows.

> Note: Make sure to use the exact name of the event when trying to trigger a worflow by firing the custom event.
<Tip>
  Cobalt do not check for the event model properties when the event is fired by the user. If a event property is mising in the event payload being fired,
  Cobalt simply ignores the property and passes a null value subsequently if the property is being used as a variable in any of the associated worflows
