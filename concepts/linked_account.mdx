title: Linked Accounts
---

Linked Accounts refers to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using Cobalt. These end-users are the ultimate beneficiaries of the seamless automation and streamlined workflows created using Cobalt.

## Creating Linked Accounts
Linked Accounts can be created either through the Cobalt Dashboard or via the API.

<Accordion title="via Cobalt Dashboard" icon="laptop">
In the Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to the `Linked Accounts` section where you have two options for adding linked accounts:

1. **+ Add Account button** 

Users can click on **+ Add Account** to create a single Linked Account, where they provide essential details such as the **Linked Account ID**, **Name** and optionally add an **UDF parameter** if required.
<Tip>Learn more about UDF parameters in detail [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/platform/linked-account/udf).</Tip>

2. **Bulk CSV Import**

Alternatively, users can opt for the bulk CSV import option, enabling them to add multiple linked accounts in one go. Simply click on `Import` icon and upload the CSV File. The sample format of the CSV can be checked by clicking on `Download Sample CSV`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="via API" icon="code">
For users seeking programmatic control and automation, Cobalt offers the flexibility to create linked accounts via the API. By utilizing the [**Create Linked Account**](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/customer/create-linked-account) API endpoint, users can integrate linked account creation into their existing workflows and systems.

Refer below to understand how you can implement it:
<CodeGroup>
    ```JavaScript cURL
    curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/linked-account \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>",
  "your_app": {}
}'
    ```
    ```JavaScript SDK
   try{
    await Client.createLinkedAccount({
        linked_account_id: "user@example.com",
        name: "User",
        udf: {
            "phone": "1234567890",
            "address": "123, Queen Street"
        },
        your_app:{
            app_id: "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a2ea",
            auth_credentials:{
                "Authorization": "eyJvcmdfaWQiOiI2M2M5M2RhMGI0NmI3MjQzNzg1YTFlMTciLCJsaW5rZWRfYWNjb3VudF9pZCI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4IiwiZW52aXJvbm1lbnQiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiaWF0IjoxNjg2NjQzMDg5LCJleHAiOjE2ODY5MDIyODl9"
            }
        }
    })
}catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
    ```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Integration Logs">
Integration Logs in Cobalt allow you to monitor and troubleshoot the authentication and connectivity status of an integration for a linked account.


To check the Integration Logs, under **Integrations** in `Overview`, click on the three-dot menu of any integration and select `Logs`.

<img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Linked-account/logs-navigation.png" alt="Navigation for Linked Account Integration Logs"/>

This will display logs in chronological order of all auth events associated with the integration.

### Log Entries

The logs show various events related to authentication of an integration of a particular Linked Account. It consists of the event name alongwith the date and timestamp when event occured.

The logs include the following events:
 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration Created">
    This entry is logged when the Linked Account successfully connects to the integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Deleted">
    This entry appears when the Linked Account disconnects from the integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Expired">
    This indicates that the API key or Access token for the integration has expired, potentially disrupting the workflow.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Reauthenticated">
    This is logged when the Linked Account reconnects with the integration after providing the new API key or generating a new access token when the previous credentials expired, ensuring continued functionality.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Connection Failed">
    This entry appears when the authentication fails for the integration for reasons like incorrect API Key, OAuth failure etc.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

<img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Linked-account/logs-entries.png" alt="Different Logs entries"/>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. UDF Parameter">
    **UDF (User Defined Field) parameters** in Cobalt allows you to assign custom key-value pairs to Linked Accounts.

These parameters enable users to tailor workflows and configurations based on specific criteria defined by the UDF values.

To create a UDF parameter for a Linked Account, follow these steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Linked Account">
    Choose the Linked Account for which UDF needs to be added and click on the `Update UDF` button in the right side.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add UDF">
    Specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value, click on `+` and click on the `Save` button.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Linked-account/udf-create.png" alt="Create a UDF Parameter"/> 
  </Step>
</Steps>
The UDF Parameter is added to the Linked account.

UDF parameters simplify workflow access control within the Cobalt platform.

In the **Config Portal** of a Workflow, users have the option to define **Access** conditions, such as `Match all conditions` or `Match any condition`. Users can then specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value that should be allowed to access the Workflow.
<img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Linked-account/udf-config.png" alt="Config Portal in a Workflow"/> 

## Sample Use Case of UDF
Let's consider a scenario where the user requires that only few users with the Admin rights can **Reply in a Thread** in Slack. To manage access to this workflow within **Cobalt**, the company can utilize UDF parameters.

By assigning a UDF parameter named **Role** with values such as **Administrator**, **Member** and **Guest** to Linked Accounts, the company can filter configurations in workflows based on the role of each Linked Account. 

To use the UDF parameter in the workflow, the user will follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create UDF">
    User will create UDF parameter named **Role** in the Linked accounts and assign them values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure UDF in Workflow">
    Navigate to **Apps** > Search for **Slack** > **Workflows** > Create a new workflow or Choose an existing one > Click on `Config Portal` in the top right corner.
 <Tip>Learn how to create a workflow [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/workflow/overview). </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding UDF Condition">
    Go to `Access` > Select `Match All Conditions` > Enter `Name` as **Role** and `Value` as **Administrator** > Click on `+` > Click on `Save`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Linked-account/udf-config-eg.png" alt="Example of using UDF Parameter"/> 
  </Step>
</Steps>

This workflow will now be visible only to the Linked Accounts who have the Role as Administrator.
