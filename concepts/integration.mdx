Cobalt offers 100+ applications that can be connected with cobalt for your customers to use accross various segments such as `Accounting`, `ATS`, `HRIS`, `CRM`, `Sales`, `Marketing` and many more.
Integrating with these platforms are pretty quick and seamless too using our [Auth flow](/concepts/auth-flows) mechanisms.

### Creating and launching an Integrations
The end customers can have access to apps enabled by the user. You just need to select from any of the available applications in the app [section](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps)
of the platform and enable it.

However, for your end customer to connect with this plaform, provide authorization for their data to be accessed and for you to access their platform apis, you need
to follow the below steps:

1. Select the application and go to the settings section
2. Provide the required details under the `Configure Credentials` section of the application. For Oauth based applications Cobalt offers options to use its credentials for playing around.
Although, for going live, you would need to create a developer account for the applications, and aquire the required field data mentioned under the `Configure Credentials` section.
For example, `Client Id`, `Client secret` etc.

<Tip>
For API key auth based applications, no configuration is required on the Cobalt dashboard. You just need to enable the application. Your customer would
provide the details in the auth flow portal.
</Tip>

3. Copy the Callback URL and paste in the developer account, where it asks to provide one (Redirect URL/ Callback URL).
4. Make sure all the scopes mentioned under `Permissions and scopes` has been selected in the scopes panel in the developer account as well.
5. In the connect portal section configure any settings for you users if required.
6. Enable the app.

You're good to go! Your customer can now access the the application auth flow portal.

Once the customer connects with the application by providing the api credentials or logging in to the application from the auth flow portal, they can see the defined
settings and associated published workflows.

When your end customer successfully connects with an integration, it is reflected under the integrations section of the Linked account page.
