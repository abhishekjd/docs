title: How To Configure
---

Configuration is a customization that your end-customers can store for each of their integrations. You can create a new dataslot to store a value from 
selected or entered by your users. Some examples of dataslots are:

+ Slack - Select a channel where messages will be posted
+ Greenhouse/Lever - Select a job where candidates will be added
+ Hubspot/Pipedrive - Select a stage to which the deal has to be added
+ Docusign - Select a template from which a document will be sent to a signer

#### Create config dataslots on Cobalt's platform

The first thing is to add a new config dataslot inside each application by clicking on `Config Portal`.

There are different three types of config dataslots: Select, mapping and text. Look at the below example to set a new config dataslot.

## Handling multiple configs
Handling multiple configs is an advanced feature for users who want to store and run different configs for a single workflow. To do so, 
we need to set a unique id while calling the config() and updateConfig() functions.

#### Step 1: Setting a unique config id
You can set a unique config while calling the .config() function as shown below. Make sure that config ids are stored on your end.

```JavaScript
cobalt.config('pipedrive','configid-1');
//creating a config using an id 'configid-1' 

cobalt.config('pipedrive','configid-2');
//creating a config using another id 'configid-2' 
```
Similarly, while calling the updateConfig() function make sure that you also use the respective config id.

#### Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events
While triggering a new event from the backend SDK, you need to pass the respective config id to use the stored value inside the config.

```JavaScript
// Send the "New Contact Created" App Event
try{
    const data = await Client.event({
        linked_account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>",
        event: "New Contact Created",
        config_id: "configid-2", //event will trigger a workflow using configid-2
        payload: {
           "name": "Jeff Atwood",
            "email": "jeff@stackoverflow.com",
            "phone": "4151231234",
            "company": "Stack Overflow",
            "role": "Founder"
        }
    })
}catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
```
