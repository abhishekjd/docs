Linked Account represent your end usersâ€™ connections between your app and third-party platforms.Linked accounts need to have a unique ID. You can freely 
choose a consumer ID yourself. Most of the time, this is an ID of your internal data model that represents a user or account in your 
system (for example account:12345). If the consumer doesn't exist yet, we will upsert a consumer based on your ID.Cobalt will store all the end customer 
tokens against an unique linked account id provided by you. This API creates a Linked Account for the user for whose behalf you'd be calling the Cobalt APIs. 
The api expects linked_account_id as a mandatory field.

| Field         | Type   | Details          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| linked_account_id          | string        | Mandatory. Unique id of the end customer        |
| payload (Optional)        | object        | In the object, you can set a name of the end customer        |

```JavaScript
try {
    await Client.createLinkedAccount({
        linked_account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@some_email.com>",
        payload:{
            name: "<Name for the account>",
            }
        }
    })
} catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
```
