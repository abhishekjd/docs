title: Workflow Testing
description: Workflow Testing in Cobalt enables you to test your workflow's functionality by running it with sample payloads as you build it.
---

It allows you to:

- Execute multiple test cases for a workflow by modifying the input payload.

- Test and inspect the output values of each workflow node.

- Use the Run Node button at the bottom of each step to execute it for the authenticated Linked Account.


## Pre-requisites for Workflow Testing

Before testing a workflow, ensure the following steps are completed:


<Accordion title="Configure a Linked Account" defaultOpen="true">
Click the `Configuration` button in the workflow editor and select a **[Linked Account](https://docs.gocobalt.io/concepts/linked_account)** under `Prerequisites` for the workflow.

If the Linked Account is not authenticated with the integration or if its authentication has expired, a warning will appear.

Click the **Authorize Application** button to reauthenticate or establish a connection with the integration.

Once authentication is complete, a **Connected**  status will be displayed.
</Accordion>

<Check>Click `Next` to proceed.</Check>


<Accordion title="Provide a Sample Payload" defaultOpen="true">
Enter a payload with data to be used during workflow testing.
A sample payload will automatically load based on the event trigger defined in the workflow.
Modify the sample payload if necessary to suit your testing requirements.

</Accordion>


After completing these steps, click the `Save Configuration` button. 

<Check>Your workflow is now ready for testing.</Check>

## Steps to test

Cobalt provides options for testing both ndividual nodes or the entire workflow.

#### Testing Node
<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Node">
    Click on the node you want to test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Node">
    At the bottom of the editor, click the `Run Node` button.
<Warning>Testing for Group Node and Pagination is currently not supported.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Input and Output">
    Expand the testing modal by clicking the `^` button at the bottom and view the input and output details of the test run under the `Node` tab.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>Once the node executes successfully, a checkmark appears on the node, indicating it has been tested.</Check>


#### Testing Entire Workflow


Open the testing modal present at the bottom and switch from the `Node` tab to the `Workflow` tab.

Click on `Run Workflow` button to perform a test execution and a **Test Run** log is generated with output of each node.
<Warning>Since testing for Group nodes is not supported currently, you might not receive the logs of the group node.</Warning>

This streamlined approach of Workflow Testing ensures that your workflows perform as expected before deploying them in production.
