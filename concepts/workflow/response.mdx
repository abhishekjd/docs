title: Response Node
---
The Response Node in Cobalt serves as a crucial component for storing the final response of an instance within a workflow and making it accessible for subsequent actions within the workflow. By capturing and storing the instance's response, users can streamline the process of retrieving specific data for further processing or analysis.

This stored response in the Response Node can be viewed by navigating to `Logs` in **Cobalt** >  `Executions` > Select the Workflow log > Check the details of the Response node in the logs. It provides users with visibility into the data generated by the instance during execution.

## Configuring Data Input
The `Data` input field allows users to specify the desired data from the response. 

Users can choose from a variety of options, including selecting **DataSlots** or choosing **Nodes** that have completed before the Response Node in the workflow. Once selected, users can further refine their choice to extract specific fields or data from the response.

## Simplified Data Extraction
One of the key functionalities of the Response Node is its ability to simplify the extraction of specific data from the response generated by previous actions in the workflow. Users can specify the exact data they require by configuring the `Data` Input field within the node.



## Node Rule Conditions
Similar to other nodes in Cobalt, the Response Node also offers the option to configure **Node Rule Conditions**. Users can define conditions that must be met for the Response Node to execute.
