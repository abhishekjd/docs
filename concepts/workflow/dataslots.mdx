Dataslots represent output data generated from triggers or action steps within a workflow. They serve as variables that capture and store data, allowing users to map business logic within workflows.

## Accessing Dataslots
When configuring workflow nodes, users can access Dataslots by clicking on **Input Fields** in the node. This provides access to a wide range of variables, allowing users to select and utilize the appropriate data for their workflows.

<Tip>
Each DataSlot variable is accompanied by its data type, displayed below the variable name.

**Payload Variables**

<Tip>
Variables are listed based on the sequence of the Triggers configured in the **Start node** of the Workflow.

**Config Variables** 

These are the variables that are defined in **App config** or **Workflow config**. In the list of DataSlot variables, these are present after the list of variables from the Triggers.
