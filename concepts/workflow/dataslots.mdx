Dataslots represent output data generated from triggers or action steps within a workflow. They serve as variables that capture and store data, allowing users to map business logic within workflows. Dataslots are integral to building dynamic and responsive automation processes.

## Accessing Dataslots
When configuring workflow nodes, users can access Dataslots by clicking on **Input Fields** in the node. This provides access to a wide range of variables, allowing users to select and utilize the appropriate data for their workflows.


## Types of Dataslots
Users can search for variables in the Dataslots. 
Dataslots in Cobalt are of two types:

###  DataSlots
DataSlots encompass variables sourced from various sources, including triggers and configurations. They provide essential data for workflow execution and can be customized to suit specific requirements.

**Payload Variables**

These are the variables that are extracted from **Triggers/Events payloads**.
<Tip>
Variables are listed based on the sequence of the Triggers configured in the **Start node** of the Workflow.
</Tip>

**Config Variables** 

These are the variables that are defined in **App config** or **Workflow config**. In the list of DataSlot variables, these are present after the list of variables from the Triggers.

###  Nodes
Nodes represent data from nodes present within the current workflow. They enable users to access and utilize data generated by previous workflow components, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration.

## Data Types and Representation
Each DataSlot variable is accompanied by its data type, displayed below the variable name. Additionally, the logo associated with each variable reflects its data type, providing visual cues for easy identification. 

Data types include **number**, **text**, **object**, **email** and more ensuring compatibility and consistency within workflows.
