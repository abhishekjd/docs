title: About Custom Apps
---
Custom Apps in Cobalt provide users with the flexibility to create and integrate their own custom applications into their workflows. These custom apps function similarly to other pre-built integrations available in Cobalt, allowing users to tailor their automation processes according to their specific needs.

## Creating Custom Apps
Custom Apps can be created within the `Apps` section of Cobalt, alongside other available integrations. 

When creating a custom app, users have the option to specify various details such as the **Name**, **Category**, **Description** and **Slug** to identify the app within the Cobalt platform.

Custom App will also have a tag `Custom` written on their card in the App list.

## Authentication Methods
Custom Apps support multiple authentication methods. To setup the Authorization for the Custom App, navigate to `Authorization` in the App and choose the desired method.

The methods of **Authorization** are: 

### Key Based 

If the Custom App requires API Key based authentication, select `Key Based`. It requires users to set up an API for generating access tokens.

### OAuth 1.0 
If the App requires OAuth 1.0 auth, select `Oauth1`. It requires the user to provide information like **Auth token API**, **Token Type**, **Token Field** name etc.

### OAuth 2.0 
If you want to provide OAuth 2.0 type authorization, select `OAuth 2.0` in the methods. 

Users need to provide details such as **Client ID**, **Client ID Param Name**, **Client Secret**, **Redirect URL**, **Auth and Token URLs**, **Scopes** etc., along with the API for acquiring the access token.

### No Auth 

Select this option if no authentication is required for accessing the custom app.

## App Configuration
Similar to the pre-built integrations on Cobalt, users can configure various aspects in the Custom App, including **Actions**, **Workflows**, and App-specific configurations. 

App configuration allows users to fine-tune the behavior of the custom app according to their requirements.

## Adding Actions and Workflows
Custom Apps support the addition of Actions and Workflows, enabling users to define specific tasks and automation processes within the app. 

Actions can be created to perform specific functions or interact with external systems similar to the API Proxy in Cobalt, while Workflows allow users to orchestrate a series of actions to achieve complex automation scenarios.
