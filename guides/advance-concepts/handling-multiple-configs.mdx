title: Handling multiple configs
description: "Handling multiple configs is an advanced feature for users who want to store and run different configs for a single workflow."

In the main article, we saw that config ids were set equal to linked account id for simplicity. However, in the case of handling multiple configs, 
we need to set a unique id while calling the config() and updateConfig() functions.

#### Step 1: Setting a unique config id
You can set a unique config while calling the .config() function as shown below. Make sure that config ids are stored on your end.

```JavaScript
cobalt.config('pipedrive','configid-1');
//creating a config using an id 'configid-1' 

cobalt.config('pipedrive','configid-2');
//creating a config using another id 'configid-2' 
```
Similarly, while calling the updateConfig() function make sure that you also use the respective config id.

#### Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events
While triggering a new event from the backend SDK, you need to pass the respective config id to use the stored value inside the config.

```JavaScript
// Send the "New Contact Created" App Event
try{
    const data = await Client.event({
        linked_account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>",
        event: "New Contact Created",
        config_id: "configid-2", //event will trigger a workflow using configid-2
        payload: {
           "name": "Jeff Atwood",
            "email": "jeff@stackoverflow.com",
            "phone": "4151231234",
            "company": "Stack Overflow",
            "role": "Founder"
        }
    })
}catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
```
