title: Triggers
---

**All workflows start with a trigger**, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Available workflow trigger types include:

- App Events
- Default App Triggers
     + triggered by an integration's webhook (ex. When a new contact is created in Salesforce)
- **Scheduled**


In this section, we'll walk through common use cases for each trigger type and how you should use them.‌

#### App Event
App Events are custom events that are sent programmatically from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events 
are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users' apps.For example, you might send a "Contact Created" App Event from 
your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users' Salesforce CRM.**Once defined, an App Event can be used to trigger 
multiple workflows**. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations.

#### Default App Triggers
Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users' apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts 
are created in your users' Salesforce account to sync your users' Salesforce contacts to your application in real-time.

#### Scheduler
The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. 

+ Seconds
   (e.g. every 5 seconds)
+ Minutes
   (e.g. every 30 minutes)
+ Hourly
   (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour)
+ Daily
   (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am)
+ Weekly
   (e.g. every Monday at 12:00 pm)

Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow.
