title: Datastore Node
---
The DataStore node in Cobalt allows users to manage dynamic data within workflows. Datastores are structured with rows and columns and with the ability to create and use variables at runtime, the DataStore node let the users to store, manipulate, or retrieve data, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of workflow automation.

## Runtime Variable Creation
Users can create and utilize variables at runtime within workflows, enabling dynamic data management and manipulation. This capability allows users to adapt workflows to changing requirements and scenarios, enhancing workflow flexibility and adaptability.

## DataStore Types
The type of a Datastore can be chosen by the user when the **Create Datastore** action is selected in the node.

The DataStore node can be of two types:

This type of DataStore is specific to the respective workflow. Data stored in a Workflow Type DataStore is accessible only within the context of the workflow in which it is created.

### Config Type DataStore 

Config Type DataStore can be used across all workflows of the respective application. Data stored in a Config Type DataStore is accessible across multiple workflows within the same application in Cobalt.

## DataStore Actions
The DataStore node offers a range of actions which can be used in a Workflow:
1. Create Datastore
2. Delete Datastore
3. Get Datastores
4. Add Datastore Records
5. Search Datastore Records
6. Get Datastore Records
7. Update Datastore Records
8. Delete Datastore Records
