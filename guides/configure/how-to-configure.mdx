---

Configuration is a customization that your end-customers can store for each of their integrations. You can create a new dataslot to store a value from 
selected or entered by your users. Some examples of dataslots are:

+ Slack - Select a channel where messages will be posted
+ Greenhouse/Lever - Select a job where candidates will be added
+ Hubspot/Pipedrive - Select a stage to which the deal has to be added
+ Docusign - Select a template from which a document will be sent to a signer
