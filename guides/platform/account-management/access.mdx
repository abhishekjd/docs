Account Owners can revoke the access by clicking on the `Revoke Access` button. By default, access to the account is restricted to the account owner, ensuring data privacy and security.

### Access Approval History
The Access section provides visibility into the **Access Approval History**, allowing users to track and monitor access requests over time. Each access request is logged with a status indicating whether it is **Active** or **Revoked**, providing account owners with insight into the current access permissions granted to Cobalt.

### Compliance and Security
The Access feature in Cobalt is designed to meet compliance requirements while prioritizing data privacy and security. By giving account owners full control over their account access and providing transparency into access approval history, Cobalt ensures that organizations can maintain regulatory compliance and safeguard sensitive data effectively.
