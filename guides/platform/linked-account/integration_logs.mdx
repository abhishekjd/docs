### Log Entries

The logs show various events related to authentication of an integration of a particular Linked Account. It consists of the event name alongwith the date and timestamp when event occured.

The logs include the following events:

- **Integration Created**: This entry is logged when the Linked Account successfully connects to the integration.

- **Integration Deleted**: This entry appears when the Linked Account disconnects from the integration.

- **Integration Expired**: This indicates that the API key or Access token for the integration has expired, potentially disrupting the workflow.

- **Reauthenticated**: This is logged when the Linked Account reconnects with the integration after providing the new API key or generating a new access token when the previous credentials expired, ensuring continued functionality.
