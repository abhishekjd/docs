Linked Accounts refers to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform. These end-users play a crucial role in the ecosystem, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the seamless automation and streamlined workflows facilitated by Cobalt-powered integrations.

## Creating Linked Accounts
Linked Accounts can be created either through the Cobalt Dashboard or via the API.

### Via Dashboard
In the Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to the Linked Account section and click on `+ Add Account` button in the right corner, where they have two options for adding linked accounts:

**Create Linked Account Form**: 

Users can utilize the intuitive **Create Linked Account** form, where they provide essential details such as the **Linked Account ID**, **Name** and optionally add an **UDF parameter** if required. This method is ideal for adding individual linked accounts manually.

**Bulk CSV Import**: 

Alternatively, users can opt for the bulk CSV import option, enabling them to add multiple linked accounts in one go. Simply click on `Multiple` in the **Create Linked Account** form and upload the CSV File. The sample format of the CSV can be checked by clicking on `Download Sample CSV`. This streamlined approach is particularly useful for clients managing large volumes of linked accounts efficiently.

### Via API
For users seeking programmatic control and automation, Cobalt offers the flexibility to create linked accounts via the API. By utilizing the [**Create Linked Account**](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/customer/create-linked-account) API endpoint, users can integrate linked account creation into their existing workflows and systems.

## Managing Linked Accounts
Once created, linked accounts provide users with access to detailed information about their end-users or customers, empowering them to monitor and optimize the end-user experience effectively. Users can gain insights into various metrics, including the number of authenticated apps utilized by each linked account and the active workflows associated with them.

## Deleting Linked Account
The Cobalt Dashboard equips users with the capability to delete connections or Linked Accounts directly, providing them with enhanced control over their end-users' experience. This functionality ensures that users can manage and maintain their linked accounts efficiently, addressing any changes or updates as needed.

To individually remove a connected Integration of the Linked Account, just click on the `Bin` icon in the respective row.

To delete a Linked Account, simply click on the `Delete Account` button in the bottom left of the Linked Account page and confirm that you want to delete it.
