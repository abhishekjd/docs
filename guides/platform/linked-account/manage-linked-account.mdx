title: Managing Linked Accounts
---
Linked Accounts refers to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform.

## Creating Linked Accounts
Linked Accounts can be created either through the Cobalt Dashboard or via the API.

### via Dashboard
In the Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to the Linked Account section and click on `+ Add Account` button in the right corner, where they have two options for adding linked accounts:

**Create Linked Account Form**: 

Users can utilize the intuitive **Create Linked Account** form, where they provide essential details such as the **Linked Account ID**, **Name** and optionally add an **UDF parameter** if required. This method is ideal for adding individual linked accounts manually.
<Tip>Learn more about UDF parameters in detail [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/platform/linked-account/udf).</Tip>

**Bulk CSV Import**: 

Alternatively, users can opt for the bulk CSV import option, enabling them to add multiple linked accounts in one go. Simply click on `Multiple` in the **Create Linked Account** form and upload the CSV File. The sample format of the CSV can be checked by clicking on `Download Sample CSV`. This streamlined approach is particularly useful for clients managing large volumes of linked accounts efficiently.

### via API
For users seeking programmatic control and automation, Cobalt offers the flexibility to create linked accounts via the API. By utilizing the [**Create Linked Account**](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/customer/create-linked-account) API endpoint, users can integrate linked account creation into their existing workflows and systems.

Refer below to understand how you can implement it:
<CodeGroup>
    ```JavaScript cURL
    curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/linked-account \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>",
  "your_app": {}
}'
    ```
    ```JavaScript SDK
   try{
    await Client.createLinkedAccount({
        linked_account_id: "user@example.com",
        name: "User",
        udf: {
            "phone": "1234567890",
            "address": "123, Queen Street"
        },
        your_app:{
            app_id: "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a2ea",
            auth_credentials:{
                "Authorization": "eyJvcmdfaWQiOiI2M2M5M2RhMGI0NmI3MjQzNzg1YTFlMTciLCJsaW5rZWRfYWNjb3VudF9pZCI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4IiwiZW52aXJvbm1lbnQiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiaWF0IjoxNjg2NjQzMDg5LCJleHAiOjE2ODY5MDIyODl9"
            }
        }
    })
}catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Linked Accounts
Once created, linked accounts provide users with access to detailed information about their end-users or customers, empowering them to monitor and optimize the end-user experience effectively. Users can gain insights into various metrics, including the number of authenticated apps utilized by each linked account and the active workflows associated with them.

## Deleting Linked Account
The Cobalt Dashboard equips users with the capability to delete connections or Linked Accounts directly, providing them with enhanced control over their end-users' experience. This functionality ensures that users can manage and maintain their linked accounts efficiently, addressing any changes or updates as needed.

To individually remove a connected Integration of the Linked Account, just click on the `Bin` icon in the respective row.

To delete a Linked Account, simply click on the `Delete Account` button in the bottom left of the Linked Account page and confirm that you want to delete it.
