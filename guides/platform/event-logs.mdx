### Detailed Event Information
To view information in detail about an Event log, just click on it and a new page with the details will be launched.

Each log entry provides detailed information about the event occurrence, including its **Status**, **Event** name with its **ID**, associated **Application**, **Environment** is Test or Production, Event **Received date**, and Event **Created date**. 

The Details of an Event Log page has primarily 3 sub-sections:
1. **Workflows**: In this section, the user can see the Workflows in which the event got executed along with the ID of the Workflow. An event can get multiple workflows triggered if required and the Logs can help the user identify which were the triggered workflows.
<Note>This section will not be visible if there was no Workflow that was associated with the event.</Note>
2. **URL**: This is the **Event URL** that received the event, typically associated with a webhook endpoint. Users can review this information to trace the source of the event and analyze its impact on integration workflows.
3. **Payload**: The Payload section presents the payload data associated with the event, providing users with insights into the information transmitted during the integration process.
