title: Linked Account
---

Users or customers, also known as linked accounts in Cobalt, can be done through either the Cobalt Dashboard or API.

### via Dashboard
In the Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to the Linked Account tab, where you have two options to add linked accounts. You can use the "Create Linked Account" form, 
providing the Linked Account ID and name. Alternatively, you can use the bulk CSV import option for adding multiple linked accounts at once.

### via API
To create a linked account via API, you can use the "Create Linked Account" API endpoint.

Once the linked account is created, you will have access to detailed information about your customer, including the number of authenticated apps they have 
and the active workflows. The Cobalt Dashboard also allows you to remove connections directly, giving you more control over your users' experience.
