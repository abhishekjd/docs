## What are webhooks?

A webhook is a method to provide external applications with real-time information about data changes in a platform.

A webhook delivers data to the application at the moment that there is a change, resulting in data being pushed. Unlike REST APIs where the application polls the API at regular intervals in order to get the changed data. This makes webhooks much more efficient and friendly.

## Event Types
Currently Cobalt 5 webhook event types:

<Accordion title="Connection Created">

## How to subscribe to webhook events?
There are 2 ways to subscribe to Cobalt events:

- via the Cobalt's platform
- via the Webhook subscription API

### Via Cobalt's platform
Goto Dashboard > Webhooks section

![Webhooks](/images/Webhooks.png)

To create a Webhook subscription, enter the delivery URL of the webhook endpoint from your system, and select the desired events you want to receive webhook events for.

<Info>Webhooks should use HTTPS and expect to receive POST requests</Info>

After you pressed “Save”, you are subscribed to the Webhook events.

### Via the Webhook subscription 
You can manage the webhook subscription using our webhooks API. Visit the [API reference](/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook) 


## Receive events
On receiving an event, you should respond with an `HTTP 200 OK` to signal to Cobalt that the event was successfully delivered. Otherwise, Cobalt will consider the event delivery a failure and retry up to 3 times, with exponential backoff.
