title: Building Salesforce Integration
---
In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Salesforce integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves creating a Cobalt account, enabling the Salesforce app, upserting a Linked Account, generating session tokens, and setting up the Hosted Portal auth flow.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Cobalt Account">
## Step 1: Create Cobalt Account

To get started with the Cobalt platform, you will need to create a new account at [https://www.gocobalt.io/signup](https://www.gocobalt.io/signup) to set up your account and receive both test and production environment API keys for using the Cobalt APIs.

Once you have received your login credentials and successfully logged into Cobalt:

- Navigate to Developer in the side menu.
- Under the Setup section, you can find your Test API Key and Production API Key for integration purposes.
- You will use these API keys to authenticate your API requests during the integration process.

</Step>
<Step title="Enable the Salesforce App">
## Step 2: Enable the Salesforce App

After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Salesforce app in your Cobalt account.

<Note>Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI.</Note>

To enable the Salesforce app:

Navigate to `Apps` in Cobalt and search for **Salesforce** and enable the app by clicking on the `Go Live` button in the top right corner.

Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Salesforce.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Linked Account">
## Step 3: Create a Linked Account

A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID).

You can create or update Linked Accounts programmatically using Cobalt APIs.

To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call:
<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/linked-account \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>"'
```
</CodeGroup>


| Param | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
|linked_account_id| Mandatory | String | Unique customer identifier|
|name| Optional | String | Name of the customer|

Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step.

You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu or by using the List Linked Accounts API.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Session Token for your Linked Account">
## Step 4: Generate Token
After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely.

To create a session token, use the following API call:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript cURL
    curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/session-token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow">
## Step 5: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow
Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate their Salesforce integration accounts. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users.

Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/connect-url \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "color": "<string>",
  "bgColor": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>"
}'
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts.

Authenticate Using Hosted Portal
Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including Salesforce.

To authenticate:

Navigate to the Salesforce integration in the portal.
Click Authorize to begin the authentication process.
You will be redirected to the Salesforce connector to authorize the application.
After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to the Hosted Portal with a confirmation that the account is successfully connected.
<Info> Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. </Info>
