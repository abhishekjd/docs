Cobalt Connect allows you to integrate your application with users' systems, enabling data retrieval and seamless interaction. Connect provides a secure and 
elegant authorisation flow for your users to grant your application access to their systems. It allows your end-customers to configure specific settings for 
each integration, enhancing flexibility and customization.

#### Configuration Examples
Cobalt Connect allows end-customers to provide certain inputs for each integration. Here are a few examples of configuration options:

1. Slack: Select the channel where messages will be posted.
2. Greenhouse/Lever: Choose the job to which candidates will be added.
3. Hubspot/Pipedrive: Select the stage to which deals will be added.

#### Authorization Flow
The authorization flow in Cobalt Connect consists of three steps:

1. Open Cobalt Connect: Your application launches Cobalt Connect, enabling users to initiate the authorization flow.
2. Obtain Consent: Cobalt Connect prompts users to log in to their respective applications and grant your application the necessary permissions.
3. Configure: Users can configure the data required for the connection, such as selecting specific integration settings.

### Integration Methods
There are three ways to integrate Cobalt Connect into your application's UI:

1. Hosted Flow: This method involves redirecting users' browsers to Cobalt Connect hosted on [https://connect.gocobalt.io](https://connect.gocobalt.io). Read the detailed integration guide here.
2. Assisted Flow: Utilize the Cobalt Connect frontend SDK to embed it seamlessly within your React application. Follow the instructions provided in the integration guide here.
3. Seamless Flow: This flow allows you to white-label the in-app integrations overview and authentication experience. Implementing the assisted flow may require additional development time compared to the hosted and 
assisted flows.
