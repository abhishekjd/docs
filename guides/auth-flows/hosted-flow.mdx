title: Hosted Flow
description: "Hosted flow  is a no-code solution, so you don't need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication and configuration."
---

Behind the scenes, hosted flow implements the cobalt API endpoints and handles the following features for your customers:

- List all enabled application
- Handle the Auth flow
- Manage integration
- Search for integrations
- Integration configuration for your end user

To get started, follow the 2 steps:
1. Generate Hosted Url
2. Redirect to hosted connect

### Hosted URL

To use Hosted flow, you will need to first get the hosted URL. This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Session Token API to create a valid 
session for a user along with the hosted url. Your application can then redirects your user's browser to Connect hosted by Cobalt on 
`https://connect.gocobalt.io`


### Redirect to Connect

Once you have the hosted_url you can redirect the user to the hosted Cobalt Connect. Connect displays your enabled application. Your user can select the application they want to connect and are then prompted to log in to their account.

You can modify the UI of Cobalt connect with the `hosted_properties`

| Property | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|
| color_hex | Modify the theme color of Cobalt connect|
| customer_name | Display name of your end customer |
| logo | Display Logo of your end customer |
