title: Data Variables
---

These are variables that capture and store data from within the workflow or events, allowing users to map business logic within workflows.

## Accessing Variables
When configuring workflow nodes, users can access Dataslots by clicking on any **Input Field** in the node. This provides access to a wide range of variables, allowing users to select and utilize the appropriate data for their workflows.

<Tip>
Each variable is accompanied by its data type, displayed below the variable name.

## Types of Variables
Users can search for variables in the Dataslots. 
Dataslots in Cobalt are of two types:

###  DataSlots
DataSlots encompass variables sourced from various sources, including triggers and configurations. They provide essential data for workflow execution and can be customized to suit specific requirements.

**Payload Variables**

These are the variables that are extracted from **Triggers/Events payloads**.
<Tip>
Variables are listed based on the sequence of the Triggers configured in the **Start node** of the Workflow.
</Tip>

**Config Variables** 

These are the variables that are defined in **App config** or **Workflow config**. In the list of DataSlot variables, these are present after the list of variables from the Triggers.

###  Nodes
Nodes represent data from nodes present within the current workflow. They enable users to access and utilize data generated by previous workflow components, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration.
