title: Data Variables
---

These are variables that capture and store data from within the workflow or events, allowing users to map logic within workflows dynamically.

## Accessing Variables
When configuring workflow nodes, users can access Dataslots by clicking on any **Input Field** in the node. This provides access to a wide range of variables, allowing users to select and utilize the appropriate data for their workflows.

<Tip>
Each variable is accompanied by its data type, displayed below the variable name.

## Types of Variables
Users can search for variables in the `Insert Variable` section. 

Variables in Cobalt are of three types:

###  DataSlots
DataSlots includes variables sourced from the Application or Workflow Config created by you. Few default meta variables are also available under the Workflow Dataslots.

<Tip>
Learn more about Config [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/connectors/config/config).

###  Event

Event represents the variables that you receive in the Payload of the event. These can be used in the workflow to pass data dynamically.

###  Nodes
Nodes represent data from nodes present within the current workflow. They enable users to access and utilize data generated by previous workflow nodes.

<Info>
If you have performed a test execution of the nodes through `Input/Output` option, you will be able to see the fields generated in response of that node as variables in further nodes.
