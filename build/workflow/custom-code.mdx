title: Custom Code Node
---
The Custom Code node in Cobalt enables users to execute custom functions within workflows. Users can leverage their preferred programming language to create custom logic and functionality.

## Custom Code Input Fields
To get started with Custom Code, first provide the `Input Parameters` as a key-value pair that you want to use in code and then select your preferred language.

In the Code section, the user can write their own custom code which they want to get executed within the **yourFunction**.

**Define Node Rule Conditions**

Optionally, add **Node Rule Conditions** to the Custom Code node to specify conditions under which the custom code will be executed. Configure the conditions using the same approach as a Rule node, specifying **variables**, **operators**, and **values**.

These conditions can be configured to `Match Any Conditions` or `Match All Conditions`, depending on the workflow requirements.
