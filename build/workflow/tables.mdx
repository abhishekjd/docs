## Tables Types
The type of a Table can be chosen by the user when the **Create Table** action is selected in the `Tables by Cobalt` node.
<Info>
You can only create a Persistent table when you create one using the `New Table` option in dashboard.
</Info>

It can be of two types:
#### Non-Persistent Table

This type of Table and its data is available only within the context of the workflow execution and gets deleted once instance execution is completed. It cannot be accessed through **Tables** in dashboard.

#### Persistent Table

This Table and its data can be accessed across all the workflows in any application and are not deleted until user explicitly deletes them.
<Note>
You can find the list of all Persistent Tables in your Cobalt dashboard. 
</Note>



## Tables in dashboard

All persistent tables created in the Cobalt platform can be accessed by navigating to `Settings` > [Tables](https://staging.gocobalt.io/tables). This section provides details about each table, such as its ID and Name.

Additionally, you can click on any Table to view and manage its records directly from this interface.
