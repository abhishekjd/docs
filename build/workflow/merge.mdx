title: Merge Node
---
The Merge Node in Cobalt provides a fundamental functionality for combining multiple branches of a workflow into a single path. 

## Node Functionality

Merge node combines multiple paths within the workflow. It can:

- Converge parallel processes at a common point;
- Help avoid force creation of duplicate nodes for each potential path;

## Use Case for Merge

Consider a scenario where two parallel processes need to run simultaneously, and once both processes are completed, a common action or set of actions should be executed. So rather than replicating the same flow for each branch, leading to increased complexity and a higher number of nodes, the Merge Node allows these branches to converge seamlessly.

<Info>
The Merge will not be successful if any of the nodes which are being merged through the Merge Node are failing.

### Example Scenario

- **Parallel Processing**: You have three branches/nodes running different processes in parallel.

- **Convergence**: Once all three branches complete their respective tasks, they need to converge to perform a common action, such as creating a datastore or any other action.

By using the Merge Node, you can bring both branches together, eliminating the need to duplicate the subsequent steps for each branch.
