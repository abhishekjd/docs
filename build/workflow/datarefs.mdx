title: Data Refs
description: Data Refs allow you to create and manage references for entities across multiple integrations directly within Cobalt.
---

The references in Data Refs allow you to unify IDs from various systems under a single record in Cobalt. `Record ID` refers to the ID you create while `External ID` refers to the ID of that entity in the integration.

For example, consider a Data Ref named **Users**:
<img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/dataref.png" alt="Users DataRef in Cobalt"/>

By maintaining these mappings, Data Refs allow you to quickly access and update information across integrations.

<Note>
Each Linked Account in Cobalt maintains its own distinct Data Refs, even if they share the same name and you can filter the Data Refs for a Linked Account in Cobalt dashboard.
</Note>

## Data Refs in Dashboard

All Data Refs can be accessed and managed through the `Data Refs` section in the dashboard:

Navigate to `Settings` > [Data Refs](https://app.gocobalt.io/datarefs) and view the details such as Name, Associated Linked account ID and the records.
