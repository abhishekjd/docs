The Response Node in Cobalt serves as a crucial component for storing the final response of an instance within a workflow and making it accessible for subsequent actions within the workflow.

## Node Functionality

Response node acts as a store for workflow response. It:

- Stores the response which is received in [Workflow API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/workflow_api); &
- Stores the options to list in dataslot in Config using DataSource;

This stored response in the Response Node can be viewed by navigating to `Logs` of that workflow in Cobalt or is used in Datasource. It provides users with visibility into the data generated by the instance during execution.

## Configuring Data Input
The `Data` input field allows users to specify the desired data from the response. 

Users can choose from a variety of options, including selecting [**DataSlots**](https://docs.gocobalt.io/concepts/workflow/dataslots) or choosing **Nodes** that have completed before the Response Node in the workflow. Once selected, users can further refine their choice to extract specific fields or data from the response.

One of the key functionalities of the Response Node is its ability to simplify the extraction of specific data from the response generated by previous actions in the workflow. Users can specify the exact data they require by configuring the `Data` Input field within the node.
