title: PDF Node
---
The PDF node in Cobalt workflows allows users to create PDF files from HTML inputs or to merge multiple PDFs seamlessly.

This node supports two primary actions: 

<Accordion title="Create PDF from HTML" description="This action enables the conversion of an HTML file into a PDF document with customizable settings." defaultOpen = "true">
  
User is required to provide the **HTML** that will be converted to a PDF. Once the node is successfully executed, the generated PDF is stored in an S3 bucket, and the link to the file is provided in the response.

Optionally users can also configure other settings for the output PDF such as `Page Layout`, `Format`, `Width` and `Height`.
<Tip>
The default format for the PDF is A4.
</Tip>
If required, users can also specify a **password** to create a protected PDF document.

<Accordion title="Merge PDFs" description="This action allows the merging of multiple PDFs into a single PDF." defaultOpen = "true">

User is required to provide an **array of URLs** as an input for all the PDFs to be merged and can also set a password for the Merged PDF if required.
