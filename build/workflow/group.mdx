title: Group Node
---
The Group Node in Cobalt allows users to iterate over entities or execute a series of actions for a fixed number of iterations.

To incorporate repetitive actions or iterate over arrays within a workflow, users simply place the desired action nodes inside the Group Node and provide values for the input fields based on their requirements.

## Actions
The Group Node offers two distinct actions to choose from:
<Accordion title="Iterating Array">
Select this action when iterating over an array. When using this action, the user specifies the array to iterate over.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Fixed Iteration">
Choose this action when you want to iterate a fixed number of times. With this action, users define the number of iterations.
</Accordion>


## Input Fields
The input fields for the Group Node vary based on the selected action.
In case of `Iterating Array`, you need to provide the array which will determine the no. of times the loop will be executed while in `Fixed iteration`, you simply provide the **Number of Iterations**.

## Accessing Array Item inside Group Node

To access the array item that is being passed in the Group Node, within any node for each iteration, it can be done so by calling `array_item` object.

Consider you want to access an `Id` that is unique within each array item that is being passed in the Group Node. To do so, call the Group Node as a Variable under `Nodes` and write it as `{{group:array_item.Id}}`.
