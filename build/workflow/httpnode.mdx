## Node Functionality

HTTP node is like an external API call function within the workflow. It can:

- Call an API of your system in workflow; &
- Call an API with dynamic params values from other nodes;

## Steps to Use HTTP Node

The HTTP Node is configured to interact with the APIs of the integration that the workflow is based on. Hereâ€™s how to set up and use the HTTP Node:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the HTTP Node">
    In your workflow, drag and drop the HTTP Node from the list of available nodes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the HTTP Request">
    Once the HTTP Node is added, configure the request details like `Method`, `URL`, `Body` etc. to match the API of the integration.
  </Step>

</Steps>



By utilizing the HTTP Node, users can efficiently manage API interactions within the scope of the integration.
