title: Build your Marketplace Ecosystem
---

Ecosystem allows you to create your marketplace where users can vote and request for integrations so that you can easily priortise your next app.

Apart from the enabled apps, you can add any integration supported by Cobalt using the **Ecosystem** feature. You can access it by navigating to `Ecosystem` under **Advanced** in the dashboard.

To add any integration to your Ecosystem, navigate to that app in Cobalt and click on the `Add to Ecosystem` button.

<Note>
`Add to Ecosystem` button will not be available if the app has already been enabled.

Once added, the integration will be visible under `Upvotes` tab in the Ecosystem with the number of upvotes or request the app has received from linked accounts.

### Requesting access to integrations

The integrations that you add to Ecosystem will be visible to the Linked Accounts with the `Request Access` button in the Hosted Portal. When the user clicks on the button, a form will open up asking for basic details about the request.
