title: Azure
description: This guide helps you install and deploy Cobaltâ€™s on-prem solution on your Kubernetes cluster in Azure. It covers the setup of essential dependencies, including Redis and MongoDB, and guides you through creating a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. After successfully setting up your cluster, you'll configure your environment to pull images from our private Docker repository and install our services via Helm charts.
---

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- Docker credentials (you will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team)
- Redis (managed or self-hosted)
- MongoDB (managed or self-hosted, recommended: MongoDB Atlas)


## 1. Setting Up Azure CLI on Your Local Machine

To interact with Azure services and your AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster, you need to set up the Azure CLI on your local machine.

### Step 1: Install Azure CLI

1. Download and install the Azure CLI by following the instructions provided in the [official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli):

- Install the Azure CLI.

2. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
az --version
```

### Step 2: Sign in and Configure Azure CLI

After installation, sign in to your Azure account:

1. Run the command:
```bash
az login
```

2. Follow the prompts to authenticate.


## 2. Redis Setup

You can either use a managed Redis instance (via Azure Cache for Redis) or host Redis yourself.

### Option 1: Managed Redis (Azure Cache for Redis)

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for **Azure Cache for Redis** and create a new cache instance.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **DNS name**: Choose a unique name for your Redis instance.
   - **Pricing tier**: Select the appropriate tier based on your requirements.
   - **Eviction policy**: Configure to `noeviction` to ensure Redis works properly with BullMQ.
4. After creating the instance, note down the **hostname** and **primary key** for configuration.
5. Ensure your AKS cluster has network access to the Redis instance. You may need to configure **virtual network (VNet) integration** and **firewall rules**.

### Option 2: Self-Hosted Redis Installation

1. Install Redis using Helm on your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install redis bitnami/redis --set redis.configuration="maxmemory-policy noeviction"
```

2. Verify Redis installation:

```bash
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- redis-cli ping
```


## 3. MongoDB Setup

You can either use a managed MongoDB instance with MongoDB Atlas or host MongoDB yourself.

### Option 1: Managed MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account or log in.
2. Create a new cluster:
    - Choose the appropriate region based on your workload and proximity to your Kubernetes cluster.
    - Select the cluster tier (e.g., M10, M20, etc.) depending on your usage needs.
3. Once the cluster is created, set up access:
    - Add your Kubernetes cluster's IP address (or CIDR) to the **IP Whitelist** to allow access.
    - Create a database user with proper permissions (e.g., `readWrite`).
4. Get the connection string:
    - Navigate to your cluster, click **Connect**, and copy the connection string. Use this connection string in your configuration files to connect your services to MongoDB.

### Option 2: Self-Hosted MongoDB Installation

1. Install MongoDB using Helm:
    ```bash
    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --set auth.rootPassword=<password>,auth.username=<user>,auth.password=<password>,auth.database=<db_name>
    ```
2. Verify MongoDB installation:
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mongodb -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- mongo --eval "db.stats()"
    ```


## 4. Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on Azure (AKS)

### Step 1: Creating an AKS Cluster

To set up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure, you can use **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

1. Navigate to the **[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)**.
2. Search for **Kubernetes services** and click **Create**.
3. Configure the following details:
   - **Resource group**: Create a new one or select an existing one.
   - **Kubernetes cluster name**: Name your cluster (e.g., `cobalt-cluster`).
   - **Region**: Select the appropriate region.
   - **Node size**: Choose a node size (e.g., `Standard_DS2_v2`).
   - **Node count**: Set the initial node count as needed.
4. Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

### Step 2: Connect to Your AKS Cluster

After your cluster is created, connect to it using the **Azure CLI**:

Run the following command to configure `kubectl`:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name cobalt-cluster
```

### 5. Creating Docker Registry Credentials

Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you'll need to create a secret to pull Docker images from the private GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). You will receive a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** from the Cobalt team.

Run the following command to create the secret:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
    --docker-server=https://ghcr.io \
    --docker-username=<user-name> \
    --docker-password=<PAT> \
    --docker-email=<email> \
    -n services
    ```

<Info>
This command creates a secret named regcred in the services namespace that will allow Kubernetes to authenticate and pull images from the private repository.
</Info>


## 6. Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Provided by Cobalt

As part of the Cobalt setup, you'll receive **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** from our team. These files contain important configurations such as `REDIS_HOST`, `MONGODB_URI`, and other service-related settings.

### Option 1: Manually Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets

1. **Update the YAML Files**:
   - Modify the received ConfigMap and Secret YAML files with your environment-specific values.
   - For example, update `REDIS_HOST`, `MONGODB_URI`, and other configurations to match your setup.

2. **Apply the Files**:
   - Use the following commands to apply the ConfigMaps and Secrets to your Kubernetes cluster:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f <configmap.yaml> -n services
     kubectl apply -f <secret.yaml> -n services
     ```

3. **Replace and Repeat for All Files**:
   - Replace `<configmap.yaml>` and `<secret.yaml>` with the actual file names you received.
   - Apply this process for each ConfigMap and Secret file provided by Cobalt.

<Info>
Notes:
- Ensure you are in the correct namespace (`services`) when applying these configurations.
- Double-check all values in the files to avoid misconfigurations.
</Info>

### Option 2: Using `apply_all.sh` Script

Alternatively, you can use the provided `apply_all.sh` script to apply all ConfigMap and Secret files at once after updating the values.

1. **Update the YAML Files**:
   - Ensure you have updated all necessary values (e.g., `REDIS_HOST`, `MONGODB_URI`, etc.) in the provided YAML files.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using the following command:

     ```bash
     ./apply_all.sh
     ```

   - The script will automatically apply all the updated YAML files (ConfigMaps and Secrets) to your Kubernetes cluster, simplifying the process.

<Info> 
Notes:
- Verify that all YAML files are updated correctly before running the script.
- Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using:

  ```bash
  chmod +x apply_all.sh
</Info>


## 7. Installing Cobalt Services via Helm

After setting up Redis, MongoDB, the Kubernetes cluster, Docker registry credentials, ConfigMaps, and Secrets, you are ready to install the Cobalt services.

### To Install Cobalt Services

1. Use the provided `install_all.sh` script to install all necessary services:

   ```bash
   ./install_all.sh

2. This script will handle the installation of all Cobalt services on your Kubernetes cluster, streamlining the deployment process.

<Info> 
Notes:
- Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using:

  ```bash
  chmod +x install_all.sh
</Info>

### To Uninstall Cobalt Services

If you need to uninstall the services, use the provided `uninstall_all.sh` script:

```bash
./uninstall_all.sh
```
This script will cleanly uninstall all Cobalt services from your cluster.
