title: On Standalone Machine
description: This guide helps you to install Cobalt using Docker images on any standalone machine. We will use Amazon EC2 as reference in the guide.
---
## **Pre-requisites**

Following are the pre-requisites for deployment:

1. **Docker Credentials**: You will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team.
2. **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Create or use an existing account.
3. **Docker Registry URL**: Provided by the Cobalt team.


## Steps to Deploy Cobalt on an EC2 Instance
To deploy Cobalt, follow the steps given below:


### **Step 1: Ensure Docker Engine is Running**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Docker if not already installed">
    ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install docker.io -y
     ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start and enable the Docker service">
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start docker
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Docker is running">
     ```bash
     docker --version
     docker info
     ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
    

### Step 2: Set Up MongoDB Cluster


- Log in to your **MongoDB Atlas** account and create a new `M10 cluster`.
- Set **autoscaling** with a maximum scale to`M20`.
- Configure **minimum disk space to 50GB** in the cluster settings.
- Create a **MongoDB user** with full access to the database:
        **Username**: Choose a secure username.
        **Password**: Use a strong password.
- Save the **MongoDB connection string**. For e.g.:
     ```
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```


### **Step 3: Authenticate Docker with Cobalt Credentials**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to the Docker registry">
     ```bash
     docker login <docker-registry-url>
     ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Credentials">
    Enter the **username** (PAT) and **password** when prompted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 4: Pull the Docker Compose File**:
    Download the `docker-compose.yml` file provided by the Cobalt team:
     ```bash
     curl -O <docker-compose-url>
     ```

### **Step 5: Configure Environment Variables**:
    Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the MongoDB connection string:
     ```yaml
     environment:
       MONGO_URI: "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
     ```
   <Note>
   Add any additional environment variables specific to your deployment.
   </Note>

### **Step 6: Start Cobalt Services**:
   - Run the Docker Compose setup:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - Verify that all containers are running:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

## **Optional Checks**
1. **Security Groups**:

    Ensure the EC2 instance's **Security Group** allows inbound traffic on necessary ports (e.g., `80`, `443`, or custom application ports).

2. **Volume Mounts**:

    If any Docker services require persistent storage, check that **volumes** are correctly configured in the `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Logs**:

    Monitor logs to ensure all services are running correctly:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

## **Additional Considerations**
1. **Resource Monitoring**:

   - Check the EC2 instance's CPU and memory usage to ensure it meets Cobalt's requirements.
   - Set up **autoscaling groups** on memory usage if it exceeds **75%** for a sustained period. This ensures the system can handle increased loads efficiently.

2. **Redis Configuration**:

    This document assumes that **Redis** will run on the same instance as Cobalt's service. This setup is acceptable for light to moderate loads, but for high loads, consider deploying Redis on a separate instance or using a managed Redis service.

3. **Backup**:

    Set up regular backups for your MongoDB cluster to avoid data loss.
