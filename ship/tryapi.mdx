title: Try API
description: More about the Try API Settings and how it can assist you to fire and test workflows in Cobalt.
---

The **Try API** feature in Cobalt allows users to simulate event or workflow execution, providing a convenient way to test workflows and validate the behavior of associated actions.

<Info> The Try API feature can be utilized in both **Production** and **Test** environments.</Info> 

Events selected through the Try API interface can serve as triggers within workflows. The payload associated with the selected event is loaded by default within the Try API interface and users can make necessary modifications to it before firing the event.
<Tip>
Using **Try API**, you can simulate execution for workflows with `Event based` triggers or `Workflows API` triggers.
</Tip>

### Pre-Condition
Before utilizing the Try API feature, ensure that the Application is connected for the Linked Account and configured properly.

- Navigate to the Application for which you want to create and test a workflow.
- Create a workflow and add an **Event** or **Workflow API** depending on your use-case in the Start Node, along with associated actions. Publish the workflow to make it available for execution.
<Tip>
Learn more about how to create workflows [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/overview).
</Tip>
- Enable the workflow for a Linked Account after making a successful connection through authenticating.

### Execution
To fire an event in the Try API section, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the **Try API** section in Cobalt.
- You will have 2 options to perform execution depending on the trigger added:
