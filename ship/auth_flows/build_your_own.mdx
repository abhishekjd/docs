title: Build your own Frontend
description: Utilize our REST APIs and NodeJs SDK methods to implement and customize the authentication experience.
---


Cobalt provides APIs and SDK functions that allow your customers to connect your platform with the third party applications.

## Pre-requisites
Below are a few pre-requisites that you need to do before moving forward:

**1. Create Linked Account**

In order to enable your customer to connect to third party app, you first need to create a Linked account for them using a unique identifier.
<Note>
Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/basics/linked_account).
</Note>

<Tip>
We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app.
</Tip>

**2. Generate Session Token**

  [Generate a Session Token](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/session-token/generate-token-for-linked-account) for your Linked Account.

  <Warning>
  The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours.
  </Warning>

## Steps to implement

The general steps to build your own flow are:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Display a list of integrations for your users to select">
Retrieve a list of all integrations available to connect using the [List Applications API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/integration-meta/list-applications) or [.getApplications()](https://docs.gocobalt.io/sdks/server-side-sdks/nodejs-sdk#getapplications) method and display them in your UI.
<CodeGroup>

``` JavaScript cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/application \
  --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>'
```
```JavaScript NodeJS
try{
    const data = await Client.getApplications("<linked_account_id>", {
        page:5,
        limit:10
    })
}catch(error){
    //Catch any error
}
```
</CodeGroup>

With the above call you can get all the details related to an appliction for a user.

<Tip>
We recommend using the assets provided by Cobalt as they meet the requirements of the supported integrations. For example QuickBooks 
Online require the specific use of QuickBooks branded buttons, including specific hover states.

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Install and Initialise SDK">

  Install the Cobalt Frontend SDK for JavaScript that you want to use. You can install by either using `npm package manager` or directly in browser by using the `script` tag.

```html
<!-- use a specific version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0.1"></script>

<!-- use a version range instead of a specific version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0"></script>

<!-- omit the version completely to use the latest one -->
<!-- you should NOT use this in production -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js"></script>
```

Initialize the javascript SDK using the Session token.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Connections">
Cobalt provides the flexibility for you to manage your customers' application connections. The [`.connect()`](https://docs.gocobalt.io/sdks/client-side-sdks/js-sdk#connect) method
lets your customers to connect to an application platform, authorizing you to access the platform APIs and data on their behalf.

```Javascript
cobalt.connect("slack") // opens a new tab for oauth apps
cobalt.connect("twilio", {
  number: <"Registered number">,
  sid: "ACCOUNT_SID",
}) // saves the auth data for key based apps
```

The [`.disconnect()`](https://docs.gocobalt.io/sdks/client-side-sdks/js-sdk#disconnect) method similarly, lets the user to disconnect from the application platform, revoking
the authorization and deleting any and all configurations of the Linked account saved for that particular application.

```Javascript
cobalt.disconnect("slack")
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Allow users to configure the connection">
Once the user has successfully authenticated in their platform, he is redirected back to your app integration page. Use the [`.config()`](https://docs.gocobalt.io/sdks/client-side-sdks/js-sdk) method to find an 
exisiting config or creating a new config for the linked account. 

``` Javascript
cobalt.config({
  slug: "slack",
  config_id: "OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG",
  labels: {}, // optional dynamic labels
})
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Save/Update the configuration">
The `.config()` method provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user. The user can now enable the workflows,
enter data for the settings and map fields. These updates to the config can be made using the [`.updateConfig()`](https://docs.gocobalt.io/sdks/client-side-sdks/js-sdk#updateconfig) method.

```Javascript
cobalt.updateConfig({
  slug: "slack",
  config_id: "OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG",
  fields: {
    "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d": "C044U7Q074J"
  },
  workflows: [
    {
      id: "64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe",
      enabled: true,
      fields: {
        "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f": "C044U7Q074J"
      }

    }
  ]
})
```
  </Accordion>
