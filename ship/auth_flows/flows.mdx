When creating application integrations, accessing customer's data is a required step. Using Cobalt's auth flows this process becomes both
quick and heavily customizable.

## Pre-requisites
Below are a few pre-requisites that you need to do before choosing an Auth Flow:

**1. Create Linked Account**

In order to enable your customer to connect to third party app, you first need to create a Linked account for them using a unique identifier.
<Note>
Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/basics/linked_account).
</Note>

<Tip>
We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app.
</Tip>

**2. Generate Session Token**

  [Generate a Session Token](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/session-token/generate-token-for-linked-account) for your Linked Account.

  <Warning>
  The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours.
  </Warning>
