2. Slack OAuth app credentials added to Cobalt. Refer [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/resources/integration-providers/slack#creating-an-app-in-slack).
3. Trigger created in Cobalt. Refer [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/workflow/triggers).
4. Linked Account available. Refer [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/platform/linked-account).

## Building a Workflow

#### 1. Create Workflow in app
* Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Slack` > `Workflows` > `Add Workflow` > Choose `Manually` > Give it a name and click on `Add Workflow`.

#### 2. Adding the Trigger
To add a trigger for a Workflow in Cobalt, you need to select details about the Trigger like the Type and which trigger to be implemented.

To add a Trigger, follow these steps:
* Click on the **Start node** to add a trigger.
* In the right side, select the **Type** and the **Trigger** and click on the `Add Trigger` button.

#### 3. Adding the Slack Action

* From `Actions`, add a Slack node to the workflow.
* Click on the node and select an Action from the `Choose an Action` dropdown menu.
*  Since we will send a message to a channel or a user through the action, provide a `User or Channel ID` and click on `Save`.

<Warning>
Before clicking on `Save`, make sure that you have entered data for all the mandatory fields whichever required.
</Warning>
* Connect the two nodes by clicking on `+` button on the `Start` node and dragging the arrow to the **Slack** node.

#### 4. Publishing the Workflow
* To publish the workflow, click on the `Publish` button in the top, **Select Environments** of the Workflow and click on `Publish`.

## Enabling the Workflow
To enable a workflow, end user or a Linked Account needs to Toggle On the Workflow after connecting with the application.

* Navigate to the Linked Account in which the Workflow needs to be enabled by getting its' **Hosted URL**.

* Go to the Hosted URL and select **Slack** from `Manage your Integrations` list.
* Click on the `Connect` button, review the permissions and allow them for a successful connection.
* After a successful connection, you can see the `Configure` section in the Slack Application page.
* Enable the Workflow **Send Message** by turning the **toggle On** and click on `Save`.

## Fire an App Event 

Lastly, we'll fire an App Event whenever a contact is created in your app by using the Workflow.

* Navigate to `Try API` in **Cobalt**.
* Choose the **Linked Account** created to test the workflow, select the **Event** and Slack as the **Application**.
* Click on the `Fire Event` button in the top right.

* You can check the status of the event by navigating to `Logs` > `Events` in **Cobalt**.

Congratulations! We have successfully built a Slack integration that sends message from your app to the Linked Account's Slack.
