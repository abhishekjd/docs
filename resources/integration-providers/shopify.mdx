#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section.

For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, the app will now request for access of the mentioned scopes.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform.
</Warning>

#### Access to protected customer data
Some Shopify APIs alongwith the scopes, also require access to **protected customer data**. For eg. Abandoned checkouts, Draft Order etc.

**To Request Access of protected customer data**:

1. In the left menu of the App, select `API access`.
2. Scroll down to `Access requests` section > `Protected customer data access` > `Request access`.

3. Select `Protected customer data`, provide your reasons for using it, and click `Save`.
4. Complete rest of the requirements and submit the app for review.

#### Managing Distribution of the Shopify App
After you've added features to your app, you need to decide how you want to distribute it to merchants.

Shopify has 2 types of distribution which depends on the purpose and audience of the app.
- **Public Distribution** :
  This distribution ensures that the app is public and can be installed on multiple Shopify stores. App needs to be submitted to Shopify for approval and public use.

- **Custom Distribution** :
  This distribution allows the app to be installed only on a single Shopify store or on multiple stores that belong to the same Plus Organization.

Learn more about app distribution [here](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/distribution).

**To setup Shopify App Distribution:**

1. In the left menu of App settings, navigate to `Release` > `Distribution`.
2. Choose a distribution from `Select a distribution method`.

<Warning>
You can't change the distribution method after you select it, so make sure that you understand the different capabilities and requirements of each type.
</Warning>
3. Click on `Select` and confirm the distribution selected.
4. If selected `Public Distribution`, ensure that all the requirements are satisfied and submit the app for review by clicking on `Create a listing`.
5. If selected `Custom Distribution`, provide the **Store domain** of the Shopify Store which is on the same Plus Organization as the one you are developing the app for.
