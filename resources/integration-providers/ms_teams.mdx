## Creating a Teams bot

#### New Bot creation steps
To create a Microsoft Teams bot, please follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log in to your [Microsoft Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to `Tools` in the side menu and select `Bot Management`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_bot.png" alt="Navigation for Bot setup"/>
3. Click on `+ New Bot` > provide a **Name** and click on `Add`. It's recommended to append a word like `Bot` so that it's easy to identify this later on.

#### Associate Teams bot to application

Now, you need to associate this bot with your Teams application.

1. In the Teams Developer Portal, navigate to `Apps` in the side menu.
2. If you do not have a Teams app yet, click New app and provide a name. This name will be the one displayed in the Microsoft Teams store and to your users.

    - In `Basic information`, you need to provide a **short description** and **URLs** for your application's website, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use.

    - Click `Save` below.
    <Note>
    Ensure that all the fields for App in `Basic information` are provided, otherwise it gives error while uploading the app in Teams for testing.
    </Note>
3. Under `Configure` in the side menu of the app, click on `App features`.
4. Select `Bot` and choose the Bot that you created above in `Select an existing bot`, choose capabilities as applicable and click on `Save` below.

#### Testing Microsoft Teams Bot

If your app is not published on the Microsoft Teams App Store, then follow the steps given to test your app in Teams:

1. In your [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home), go to the `App` created for testing.
2. Click on the triple-dot menu of the app and choose `Download app package` option. The package will get downloaded as a **.zip** file.

3. Go to the [Microsoft Teams account](https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/) in which you would like to test the app and it's authentication.
<Note>
You will not be able to login into the platform correctly if appropriate license or permissions are missing.
</Note>
4. Click `Apps` option in the side menu and click on `Manage your apps` option at the bottom.
5. Click on `Upload An App` and `Upload your app to your org's app catalog` and select the .zip file that you downloaded and you will be navigated to the `Built for your org` page.

<Tip>
If you uploaded the app through `Submit an app to your org` option, then the admin can approve it by going to [Teams Admin Centre](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) > `Teams Apps` > `Manage Apps` > Search for the app that you submitted > Click on the app name to open its app details page and change the status to `Allowed`.

Refer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-apps).
</Tip>
6. After a successfull upload, select your app. Click on `Add` and `Add to a team` and add the bot to a team and a channel.

## Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_cobalt.png" alt="Setting up application client credentials"/>

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

## Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_scopes.png" alt="OAuth Scopes"/>

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt and follow **Step 6** and **7** [above](https://docs.gocobalt.io/resources/integration-providers/ms_teams#creating-an-app-in-microsoft-azure).

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

## Actions and triggers
