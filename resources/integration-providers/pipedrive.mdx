#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Pipedrive developer account dashboard](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `OAuth & access scopes` under App Settings > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on `Save`. 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Pipedrive actions and triggers. Following are the set of Pipedrive actions and triggers
supported by Cobalt.
