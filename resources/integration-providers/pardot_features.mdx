## Building a Workflow

#### 1. Create Workflow in app

#### 2. Adding the Trigger
To add a trigger for a Workflow in Cobalt, you need to select details about the Trigger like the Type and which trigger to be implemented.

To add a Trigger, follow these steps:
* Click on the **Start node** to add a trigger.
* In the right side, select the **Type** and the **Trigger** and click on the `Add Trigger` button.

#### 3. Adding the Pardot Action

* From `Actions`, add a Salesforce_Pardot node to the workflow.
* Click on the node and select an Action from the `Choose an Action` dropdown menu.
* Enter the `Email` of the prospect in **Input Fields** and click on the `Save` button.
<Warning>
Before clicking on `Save`, make sure that you have entered data for all the mandatory fields whichever required.

* Connect the two nodes by clicking on `+` button on the `Start` node and dragging the arrow to the **Salesforce_Pardot** node.

#### 4. Publishing the Workflow
* To publish the workflow, click on the `Publish` button in the top, **Select Environments** of the Workflow and click on `Publish`.

## Enabling the Workflow
To enable a workflow, end user or a Linked Account needs to Toggle On the Workflow after connecting with the application.

* Navigate to the Linked Account in which the Workflow needs to be enabled by getting its' **Hosted URL**.

* Go to the Hosted URL and select **Pardot** from `Manage your Integrations` list.
* Enter the **Base URL** and **Business ID** > click on the `Connect` button > review the permissions and allow them for a successful connection.

* After a successful connection, you can see the `Configure` section in the Pardot Application page.
* Enable the Workflow **Create a Prospect** by turning the **toggle On** and click on `Save`.

## Fire an App Event 

Lastly, we'll fire an App Event whenever a contact is created in your app by using the Workflow.

* Navigate to `Try API` in **Cobalt**.
* Choose the **Linked Account** created to test the workflow, select the **Event** and Pardot as the **Application**.
* Click on the `Fire Event` button in the top right.

* You can check the status of the event by navigating to `Logs` > `Events` in **Cobalt**.

Congratulations! We have successfully built a Pardot integration that syncs prospects from your app to your Linked account's Pardot.
