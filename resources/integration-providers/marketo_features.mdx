## Building a Workflow

#### 1. Create Workflow in app

To add a Trigger, follow these steps:

## Enabling the Workflow
To enable a workflow, end user or a Linked Account needs to Toggle On the Workflow after connecting with the application.

* Navigate to the Linked Account in which the Workflow needs to be enabled by getting its' **Hosted URL**.

* Enter the required fields and click on `Connect`.
* After a successful connection, you can see the `Configure` section in the Marketo Application page.
* Enable the Workflow **Create a new company** by turning the **toggle On** and click on `Save`.

## Fire an App Event 

Lastly, we'll fire an App Event whenever a contact is created in your app by using the Workflow.

* Navigate to `Try API` in **Cobalt**.
* Choose the **Linked Account** created to test the workflow, select the **Event** and Marketo as the **Application**.
* Click on the `Fire Event` button in the top right.
