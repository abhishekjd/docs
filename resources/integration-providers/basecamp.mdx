3. Enter the `Name of your application`, `Company Name` and `Website URL` and select `Product` as **Basecamp 4**.
4. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Basecamp` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it. Paste the Callback URL under `Redirect URI` in Basecamp and click on the `Register this app` button.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Basecamp actions and triggers. Following are the set of Basecamp actions and triggers
supported by Cobalt.
