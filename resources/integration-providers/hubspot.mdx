App settings page lets you configure the authhentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

#### Configuring credentials

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials` and provide the required data and save. It is required that you have already created an application inside the respective platform first.
Go to the application and acquire the credentials required in Cobalt's app setting page.

#### Scopes

Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be
removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Callback URL

While creating an installable app on a platform, the platform asks the developer to provide a redirect URL which it would be calling to send across the authorization code once a 
user installs the application. Copy the Callback URL provided on the app settings page and paste it where the platform asks for the redirect url.
