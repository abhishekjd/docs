To setup your Hubspot app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your [Hubspot developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/login?hubs_signup-url=developers.hubspot.com/&hubs_signup-cta=cta--small):
- Client Id
- Client Secret
- Scopes

### Required Settings

* **Mandatory Scopes** 
1. oauth
2. crm.objects.owners.read

<Info>If you do not already have a developer account, you would need to create one [here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup/developers).</Info>

#### Acquiring Hubspot client credentials

1. Login to your Hubspot (developer account dashboard)[https://developers.hubspot.com/].
2. Select `Manage Apps`, and choose from the applications that you'd like your end customers to install.
3. Go to `Basic info` > `Auth` > `Auth settings` > `App Credentials` and acquire the `Client Id` and `Client Secret`.

#### Adding Redirect URL in the Hubspot developer app
While creating an installable app on a platform, the platform asks the developer to provide a redirect URL which it would be calling to send across the authorization code once a 
user installs the application. 

Select Hubspot from `Apps` and copy the Callback URL provided in the app settings page. Under `Auth` > `Auth Settings` > `Redirect URLs`, paste the copied URL.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your Hubspot (developer account dashboard)[https://developers.hubspot.com/] and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Go to  `Manage Apps` > `Basic info` > `Auth` > `Auth settings` > `Scopes`, and add the scopes as added in Cobalt.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Hubspot Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Hubspot, you'd need to subscribe to Hubspot's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Hubspot webhook subscription:**

1. Select Hubspot from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`
3. Go to `Manage Apps` > `Features` > `Webhooks` in your [Hubspot Developer Account dashboard](https://developers.hubspot.com/)
4. Paste the `Single Webhook Url` inside the "Target URL" section.

<Info>
 Existing `Target URL` cannot be updated when any of the subscriptions are active. Make sure to disable all subscriptions prior to updating the URL.
</Info>

5. Click on `Create Subscription` and add revelant events when you'd want to be notified.

6. Click on the newly created subscription and `Activate` it to take effect.
