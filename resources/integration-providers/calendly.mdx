<Warning>
Client Secret and Webhook signing key will be visible only once, so make ensure that they are copied and saved somewhere for future reference.
</Warning>


#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Calendly actions and triggers. An action with any API of Calendly can be created by using the **HTTP Request** Action.
