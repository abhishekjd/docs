1. Log in to your [Snowflake account](https://app.snowflake.com/), click on your profile in the bottom left and under `Account` click on `Copy Account Identifier`. This is your Account Identifier which you need for authentication.

3. Open **Terminal/Bash** in your laptop(Linux/Mac/Windows) and type the following command:
```bash Command
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out private_key.p8 -scrypt
```
4. You will be prompted to provide `Encryption Password`. Provide a password, verify it and save it with you. This is your `Passphrase` for authentication.

This Generates a file called `private_key.p8` in the current directory.

5. Open your `private_key.p8` file in the terminal by using the following command and save it. This is your `Private Key`.
```base Command
cat private_key.p8
```

6. Generate `Public Key` using your passphrase from the 4th step by using the following command:
```bash Command
 openssl rsa -in private_key.p8 -pubout -out public_key.pem -passin pass:<your_passphrase>
```
7. Open your `public_key.pem` file that was generated in last step using the command:
```base Command
cat public_key.pem 
```
Copy the **Public Key** displayed in your terminal.

8. Go to Snowflake and click on your profile in the bottom left. Check if your current role is `ACCOUNTADMIN` or not under **Switch Role**. If not, switch role to ACCOUNTADMIN.
<Info>
ACCOUNTADMIN Role is necessary, otherwise you won't be able to assign public key to user in the next step.
</Info>
9. In Snowflake click on `Worksheets` under **Projects** in the side menu. Click on `+` icon to create a new worksheet.
10. Run the following statement in your worksheet by replacing the **Username** and **Public_key** with your own credentials.
```base Statement
ALTER USER <Username> SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY="<Public_key>"
```

The Linked Account or end-user now have all the credentials required to connect with Snowflake.
