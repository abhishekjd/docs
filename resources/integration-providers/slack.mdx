#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client Secret and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Slack App Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Navigate to  `Your Apps` > Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `OAuth & Permissions` under **Features** in the left menu  > Scroll down to the `Scopes` section > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt by clicking `Add an OAuth Scope` and select the scope.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Slack single webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Slack, you'd need to subscribe to Slack's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Slack webhook subscription:**

1. Select Slack from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`
3. In your [Slack App Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps), select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Select `Event Subscriptions` under **Features** > Turn the toggle `On` for **Enable Events**.
4. Paste the Webhook URL under `Request URL`. Cobalt will automatically respond to Slack's challenge request and begin listening to events on behalf of your app.

5. Click on `Save Changes` at the bottom of the Slack App dashboard.
